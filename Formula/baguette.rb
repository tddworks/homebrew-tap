  def install
    # Binary and its SPM resource bundle must sit side-by-side at
    # runtime — WebRoot resolves the bundle via dladdr from the
    # executable's directory. Install both into libexec and symlink
    # the binary into bin.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      baguette links against private SimulatorKit and CoreSimulator
      frameworks shipped with Xcode 26. Make sure Xcode 26 is installed
      and `xcode-select` points at it before running `baguette serve`.
