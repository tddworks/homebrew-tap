        baguette requires Apple Silicon Homebrew running natively as arm64.

        Your brew process is running under Rosetta 2, usually from Intel
        Homebrew in /usr/local. Intel Homebrew cannot install baguette.

        Install with native Homebrew instead:

          /opt/homebrew/bin/brew install baguette

        If /opt/homebrew/bin/brew does not exist, install native Homebrew
        from https://brew.sh, then run the command above.

  def install
    # Binary and its SPM resource bundle must sit side-by-side at
    # runtime — WebRoot resolves the bundle via dladdr from the
    # executable's directory. Install both into libexec and symlink
    # the binary into bin.

      baguette links against private SimulatorKit and CoreSimulator
      frameworks shipped with Xcode 26. Make sure Xcode 26 is installed
      and `xcode-select` points at it before running `baguette serve`.
